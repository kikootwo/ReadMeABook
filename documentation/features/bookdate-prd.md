# BookDate Feature - Product Requirements Document

**Status:** ⏳ Planning Phase
**Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** 2025-11-19
**Owner:** Product Team

---

## 1. Executive Summary

**What:** An AI-powered audiobook recommendation system that presents personalized suggestions in a Tinder-style swipe interface, learning from user preferences to provide increasingly accurate recommendations.

**Why:** Current audiobook discovery relies on manual browsing. BookDate leverages AI and user listening history to surface relevant audiobooks users might not discover otherwise, increasing engagement and library utilization.

**Target Users:** All ReadMeABook users (per-user personalization)

---

## 2. Feature Overview

### Core Experience
1. **Setup:** User configures AI provider, API key, model, library scope, and custom prompt
2. **Discovery:** AI generates personalized audiobook recommendations based on user's Plex library and preferences
3. **Interaction:** Swipe right (request), left (not interested), or up (neutral) on recommendations
4. **Learning:** AI refines future recommendations based on swipe history

### Key Differentiation
- **Personalized:** Recommendations based on individual user's library, listening history, and ratings
- **AI-Powered:** Leverages LLMs (OpenAI, Claude) for sophisticated matching
- **Engaging:** Tinder-style interface makes discovery fun and frictionless
- **Privacy-First:** User provides their own AI API key (no centralized cost/data)

---

## 3. User Personas

### Primary Persona: Active Listener
- **Profile:** Regularly listens to audiobooks, has completed 20+ books
- **Goal:** Discover new audiobooks similar to favorites without manual searching
- **Pain Point:** Overwhelmed by options, misses hidden gems

### Secondary Persona: Curator
- **Profile:** Admin managing family/friend Plex library
- **Goal:** Curate recommendations for diverse user preferences
- **Pain Point:** Different users have different tastes

---

- Re-verification not required on subsequent visits (trust stored config)
- If API call fails during use, show error (don't hide tab)

---

## 6. Recommendation Engine

### 6.1 AI Prompt Generation

**Context Selection Logic:**
- **Max Context Books:** 50 books
- **Context Weighting:**
  - If user has ≤50 books in selected scope: Include all
  - If user has >50 books in selected scope:
    - 40 latest added books (80%)
    - 10 latest swipes (20% - includes both left/right swipes for preference learning)
  - If user has 0 books in selected scope: Fallback to full library (with warning)

**Prompt Structure (JSON format):**

```json
{
  "task": "recommend_audiobooks",
  "user_context": {
    "library_books": [
      {
        "title": "Project Hail Mary",
        "author": "Andy Weir",
        "narrator": "Ray Porter",
        "rating": 5
      }
      // ... up to 40 books
    ],
    "swipe_history": [
      {
        "title": "The Martian",
        "author": "Andy Weir",
        "user_action": "requested"
      },
      {
        "title": "Twilight",
        "author": "Stephenie Meyer",
        "user_action": "rejected"
      }
      // ... up to 10 swipes
    ],
    "custom_preferences": "User's custom prompt text here (if provided)"
  },
  "instructions": "Based on the user's library and swipe history, recommend 20 audiobooks they would enjoy. Important rules:\n1. DO NOT recommend any books already in the user's library\n2. DO NOT recommend any books from the swipe history (whether requested, rejected, or dismissed)\n3. Focus on variety and quality\n4. Consider user ratings if available (0-10 scale, higher = liked more)\n5. Learn from rejected books to avoid similar recommendations\n6. Learn from requested books to find similar ones\nReturn ONLY valid JSON with no additional text or formatting.",
  "response_format": {
    "recommendations": [
      {
        "title": "string",
        "author": "string",
        "reason": "1-2 sentence explanation"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**AI Provider-Specific Adjustments:**
- OpenAI: Use `response_format: { type: "json_object" }` parameter
- Claude: Include "Return ONLY valid JSON, no additional text" in instructions

**Request Count:** Ask for 20 recommendations (expect to filter down to 10 usable)

### 6.2 Recommendation Filtering

**Post-AI Filtering (in order):**
1. **Audnexus Matching:** Match AI recommendation to Audnexus metadata
   - If no match: Skip silently, log warning with title/author
2. **Already in Library:** Check against user's Plex library
   - If exists: Skip
3. **Already Requested:** Check against user's request history
   - If requested: Skip
4. **Already Swiped:** Check against user's swipe history (any direction)
   - If swiped: Skip

**Target:** 10 successfully matched and filtered recommendations per batch

### 6.3 Caching Strategy

**Cache Behavior:**
- Store un-swiped recommendations in database per user
- On BookDate tab visit: Check for cached recommendations first
- If cached available: Show cached (no API call)
- If cached <10: Generate new batch to replenish
- If cached =0: Generate new batch

**Cache Invalidation:**
- User swipes on recommendation: Remove from cache
- User changes BookDate settings: Clear all cached recommendations
- Cache never expires (only removed by swipe or settings change)

---

## 7. User Interface

### 7.1 Loading State

**Initial Load (no cached recommendations):**
- Animated loading screen
- Animation: Book cover cards flying/shuffling (whimsical, well-animated)
- Duration: Until recommendations ready (typically 2-5 seconds)
- Text: "Finding your next great listen..."

### 7.2 Recommendation Card

**Card Layout:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│                             │
│      [Cover Image]          │
│        (Large)              │
│                             │
├─────────────────────────────┤
│ Title (Bold, 18px)          │
│ Author (Gray, 14px)         │
│ Narrator (Gray, 12px)       │
├─────────────────────────────┤
│ ⭐ 4.5 (Rating)             │
├─────────────────────────────┤
│ Short Description           │
│ (3-4 lines, expandable)     │
│ [Read more...]              │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

**Field Availability:**
- Title: Always shown
- Author: Always shown
- Cover: Show if available, placeholder if not
- Narrator: Show if available
- Rating: Show if available
- Description: Show if available

### 7.3 Swipe Mechanics

**Mobile (Touch):**
- **Swipe Right:** Request audiobook → Confirmation toast
- **Swipe Left:** Not interested → Next card
- **Swipe Up:** Neutral/dismiss → Next card
- **Visual Feedback:**
  - Card follows finger during drag
  - Green overlay on right drag
  - Red overlay on left drag
  - Blue overlay on up drag
  - Snap back if drag canceled

**Desktop (Buttons):**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                     │
│         [Recommendation Card]       │
│                                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
    [❌ Not Interested]  [⬆️ Dismiss]  [✅ Request]
```

- Buttons positioned below card
- Same actions as mobile swipes
- Keyboard shortcuts (optional enhancement):
  - Left arrow: Not interested
  - Up arrow: Dismiss
  - Right arrow: Request

### 7.4 Request Confirmation Toast

**Trigger:** User swipes right (mobile) or clicks "Request" (desktop)

**Toast Content:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Do you want to request "[Book Title]"? │
│                                         │
│  Or have you already read/listened      │
│  to it elsewhere?                       │
│                                         │
│  [Mark as Known] [Request] [Cancel]     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Actions:**
- **Request:** Adds to request queue, records "right" swipe, shows next card
- **Mark as Known:** Records "right" swipe only (no request), shows next card
- **Cancel:** No action, returns to card

**Toast Duration:** Persistent until user chooses (not auto-dismiss)

### 7.5 Undo Functionality

**Left/Up Swipes Only:**
- Small "Undo" button appears briefly (3 seconds) after swipe
- Position: Bottom-left corner
- Action: Restores previous card, removes swipe from history
- UX: Subtle slide-up animation

**Right Swipes:**
- No undo (already confirmed via toast)

### 7.6 Empty State

**Trigger:** User reaches end of cached + newly generated recommendations

**Message:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                     │
│   🎉 You've seen all our current    │
│      recommendations!               │
│                                     │
│   Want more suggestions?            │
│                                     │
│   [Get More] [Go Home]              │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Actions:**
- **Get More:** Generates new batch of 10 recommendations
- **Go Home:** Redirects to home page

## 8. Technical Requirements

### 8.1 Data Models

**BookDateConfig (per user):**
```typescript
{
  userId: string;
  provider: 'openai' | 'claude';
  apiKey: string; // Encrypted at rest
  model: string; // e.g., 'gpt-4o', 'claude-sonnet-4-5'
  libraryScope: 'full' | 'rated';
  customPrompt?: string;
  isVerified: boolean;
  isEnabled: boolean; // Admin-controlled global toggle
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

**BookDateRecommendation (cached):**
```typescript
{
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  batchId: string; // Groups recommendations from same AI call
  title: string;
  author: string;
  narrator?: string;
  rating?: number;
  description?: string;
  coverUrl?: string;
  audnexusAsin?: string; // For matching
  aiReason: string; // Why AI recommended this
  createdAt: Date;
  expiresAt?: Date; // NULL = never expires (manual invalidation only)
}
```

**BookDateSwipe (history):**
```typescript
{
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  recommendationId?: string; // NULL if book not from BookDate
  bookTitle: string;
  bookAuthor: string;
  action: 'left' | 'right' | 'up';
  markedAsKnown: boolean; // True if user chose "Mark as Known" in toast
  createdAt: Date;
}
```

- Otherwise: Skip failed matches, show what matched

---

## 10. Security & Privacy

### 10.1 API Key Storage
- **Encryption at rest:** API keys encrypted in database
- **No logging:** Never log API keys (even in error logs)
- **User-owned:** Each user provides their own key (no shared keys)

### 10.2 Per-User Isolation
- All queries filtered by `userId`
- Users never see other users' swipes, ratings, or recommendations
- Cache is per-user

### 10.3 Admin Controls
- Global enable/disable toggle (preserves user configs)
- Admin can't see user API keys (encrypted, write-only)

---

1. **Adoption Rate:** % of users who complete BookDate setup
2. **Engagement Rate:** % of configured users who visit BookDate tab weekly
3. **Request Conversion:** % of right swipes that become actual requests
4. **Discovery Rate:** % of requests from BookDate vs. manual browsing

### Secondary Metrics
1. **Swipe Distribution:** Ratio of right:left:up swipes (indicates recommendation quality)

## 14. Open Questions

1. **Rate Limiting:** Should we track API usage per user and warn if excessive?
2. **Cost Estimation:** Should we estimate token costs and show users?
3. **Model Recommendations:** Should we suggest specific models based on use case?
4. **Prompt Engineering:** Should we A/B test different prompt formats?
5. **Recommendation Diversity:** Should we force diversity (different genres/authors)?

---

## 15. Appendix

### A. Example AI Prompts

**OpenAI (gpt-4o):**
```json
{
  "model": "gpt-4o",
  "response_format": { "type": "json_object" },
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "system",
      "content": "You are an expert audiobook recommender. Analyze user's library and preferences to suggest audiobooks they'll love. Return ONLY valid JSON."
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "{prompt from section 6.1}"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Claude (claude-sonnet-4-5):**
```json
{
  "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929",
  "max_tokens": 2048,
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "{prompt from section 6.1}\n\nReturn ONLY valid JSON with no additional text or formatting."
    }
  ]
}
```

### B. Database Indexes

**Performance Optimization:**
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_bookdate_recommendations_user_batch ON BookDateRecommendation(userId, batchId);
CREATE INDEX idx_bookdate_swipes_user_created ON BookDateSwipe(userId, createdAt DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_bookdate_config_user ON BookDateConfig(userId);
```

### C. Token Estimation

**Average Prompt Size:**
- 40 library books × 100 tokens/book = 4,000 tokens
- 10 swipe history × 20 tokens/swipe = 200 tokens
- Custom prompt: ~100 tokens
- Instructions: ~200 tokens
- **Total Input: ~4,500 tokens**

**Average Response Size:**
- 20 recommendations × 50 tokens/rec = 1,000 tokens
- **Total Output: ~1,000 tokens**

**Cost per Batch (GPT-4o example):**
- Input: 4,500 tokens × $0.005/1k = $0.0225
- Output: 1,000 tokens × $0.015/1k = $0.015
- **Total: ~$0.04 per batch**
